# Limitations

This architecture is intentionally limited in scope.

## Known Limitations
- No support for out-of-order execution
- No branch prediction
- Simplified memory model
- Limited instruction set

## Rationale
These limitations keep the design approachable and allow focus on:
- Core pipeline mechanics
- Hazard handling strategies
- Clear architectural reasoning

Future extensions could incrementally address these limitations.
