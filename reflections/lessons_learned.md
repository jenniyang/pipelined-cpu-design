# Lessons Learned

Designing and documenting a pipelined CPU reinforced several key lessons:

- Small control mistakes can have global effects
- Clear stage boundaries simplify debugging
- Hazard handling is as important as datapath correctness
- Good documentation forces precise thinking

Writing this documentation emphasized the importance of being able to clearly explain complex systems, not just implement them.
